## advised theses

Over the years, I have had the joy of advising many students doing their Bachelor's or Master's thesis.
This list contains only theses where I also was the formal advisor. I have informally co-advised Rebecca Ghidini and Johanna Franziska Schinabeck, resulting in publications at SOAP and NSAD, respectively. The formal advisor for Rebecca and Johanna was Julian Erhard.

I am currently informally co-advising the M.Sc. thesis of Fabian Stemmler (with Julian Erhard and Sarah Tilscher), and the Guided Research of Felix Krayer (with Ali Koçal, Julian Erhard, and Sarah Tilscher).

I currently do **not** have the capacity to supervise any additional students. If you are interested in doing a student thesis related to static analysis and Goblint,
feel free to reach out to my colleagues Sarah Tilscher and Julian Erhard. For more information on possible student topics see [here](https://www.in.tum.de/i02/lehre/studienarbeiten/).
