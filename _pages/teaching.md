## advised theses

I currently do **not** have the capacity to supervise any additional students. If you are interested in doing a student thesis related to static analysis and Goblint,
feel free to reach out to my colleagues Sarah Tilscher and Julian Erhard. For more information on possible student topics see [here](https://www.in.tum.de/i02/lehre/studienarbeiten/).
