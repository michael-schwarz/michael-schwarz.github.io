Since 2019, I am a PhD candidate in Helmut Seidl's [group](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/pl/home/) and a participant in the DFG Research Training Group [ConVeY](https://convey.in.tum.de) (Continous Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems).

I am interested in **Static Analysis** and currently work within the field of **Sound Static Analysis by Abstract Interpretation**. There, we have, e.g., proposed techniques for efficient abstract interpretation of **multi-threaded programs**, worked on increasing usability by **making static analysis incremental**,
and designed **novel analyses for sometimes overlooked features** of the C programming language.

I contribute to and currently co-maintain (with [Simmo Saan](https://sim642.eu) and [Karoliine Holter](https://ut.ee/en/node/105999) from UTartu) the static analysis framework [**Goblint**](https://goblint.in.tum.de) for multi-threaded C programs, which serves as the testbed for many of our ideas.

I received a B.Sc. from TUM in 2016, and a M.Sc. from TUM in 2019. During my Master's, I spent one term on exchange at the University of Waterloo and interned at NTNU as a software engineer for one term.
